00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.920
I’m not being cranky

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I just hate this party

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.840
Think I might as well 
Spend a night in hell
Reading torture magazine

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.520
Than pretending I’m one of you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.520
They move wild and carefree

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.920
As hip as hip can be

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.920
I think I should split
But wait a minute 
I feel something in my knees

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.360
Is it music or new voodoo ?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240
Can I resist this ?

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.720
Am I off my head, what’s shaking my hips ?

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.280
Can I resist this ?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.840
It’s the kind of beat I just can’t dismiss

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.440
It’s too early for me

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.560
I can’t set myself free

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.480
Can we sit aside
I’m not qualified
I’m the worst you’ve ever seen

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.280
I’m as groovy as a bamboo

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.600
Air crawling in air sea

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760
I feel all eyes on me

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.920
They have so much grace
And I’m out of place                        
Why am ’I feeling like a queen ?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.200
Is it music or new voodoo ?

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.560
Can I resist this ?

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.640
Am I off my head, what’s shaking my hips ?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.040
Can I resist this ?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.680
It’s the kind of beat I just can’t dismiss

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.920
Can I resist this ?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.960
Am I off my head, what’s shaking my hips ?

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.400
Can I resist this ?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.440
It’s the kind of beat I just can’t dismiss
