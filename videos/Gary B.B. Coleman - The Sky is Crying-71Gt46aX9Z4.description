Album: Too Much Weekend https://amzn.to/2SwXcKO, Lyrics:The sky is cryin....Can't you see the tears roll down the street
The sky is cryin....Can't you see the tears roll down the street
I've been looking for my baby
And I wonder where can she be
I saw my baby early one morning....She was walking on down the street
I saw my baby early this morning....She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat
I've got a real real real real bad feelin
That my baby she don't love me no more
I've got a real real bad feelin that my baby don't love me no more
You know the sky, the sky's been cryin
Can you see the tears roll down my nose
