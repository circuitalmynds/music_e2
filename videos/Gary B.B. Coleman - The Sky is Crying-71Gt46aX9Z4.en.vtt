00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.880
The sky is crying

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.000
Can't you see the tears roll down the street

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.680
The sky is crying

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.180
Can't you see the tears roll down the street

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.220
I've been looking for my baby

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.300
And wonder where can she be

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.900
I saw my baby early one morning

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.220
She was walking on down the street

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.860
I saw my baby early one morning

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.700
She was walking on down the street

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.800
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.440
it made my poor heart skip a beat

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.540
I got a bad felling,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.060
my baby she don't love me no more

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.860
I got a real bad felling

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.320
my baby she don't love me no more

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.520
Yah the sky's crying ...
